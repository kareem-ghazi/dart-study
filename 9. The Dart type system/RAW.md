The Dart language is type safe: it uses a combination of static type checking and [runtime checks](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#runtime-checks) to ensure that a variable's value always matches the variable's static type, sometimes referred to as sound typing. Although _types_ are mandatory, type _annotations_ are optional because of [type inference](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#type-inference).

One benefit of static type checking is the ability to find bugs at compile time using Dart's [static analyzer.](https://dart.dev/tools/analysis)

You can fix most static analysis errors by adding type annotations to generic classes. The most common generic classes are the collection types `List<T>` and `Map<K,V>`.

For example, in the following code the `printInts()` function prints an integer list, and `main()` creates a list and passes it to `printInts()`.

static analysis: failure dart
```
void printInts(List<int> a) => print(a);
​
void main() {
  final list = [];
  list.add(1);
  list.add('2');
  printInts(list);
}
```
content_copy

The preceding code results in a type error on `list` (highlighted above) at the call of `printInts(list)`:

```
error - The argument type 'List<dynamic>' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'List<int>'. - argument_type_not_assignable
```
content_copy

The error highlights an unsound implicit cast from `List<dynamic>` to `List<int>`. The `list` variable has static type `List<dynamic>`. This is because the initializing declaration `var list = []` doesn't provide the analyzer with enough information for it to infer a type argument more specific than `dynamic`. The `printInts()` function expects a parameter of type `List<int>`, causing a mismatch of types.

When adding a type annotation (`<int>`) on creation of the list (highlighted below) the analyzer complains that a string argument can't be assigned to an `int` parameter. Removing the quotes in `list.add('2')` results in code that passes static analysis and runs with no errors or warnings.

static analysis: success dart
```
void printInts(List<int> a) => print(a);
​
void main() {
  final list = <int>[];
  list.add(1);
  list.add(2);
  printInts(list);
}
```

What is soundness?
------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#what-is-soundness)

_Soundness_ is about ensuring your program can't get into certain invalid states. A sound _type system_ means you can never get into a state where an expression evaluates to a value that doesn't match the expression's static type. For example, if an expression's static type is `String`, at runtime you are guaranteed to only get a string when you evaluate it.

Dart's type system, like the type systems in Java and C#, is sound. It enforces that soundness using a combination of static checking (compile-time errors) and runtime checks. For example, assigning a `String` to `int` is a compile-time error. Casting an object to a `String` using `as String` fails with a runtime error if the object isn't a `String`.

The benefits of soundness
-------------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#the-benefits-of-soundness)

A sound type system has several benefits:

*   Revealing type-related bugs at compile time.

 A sound type system forces code to be unambiguous about its types, so type-related bugs that might be tricky to find at runtime are revealed at compile time.

*   More readable code.

 Code is easier to read because you can rely on a value actually having the specified type. In sound Dart, types can't lie.

*   More maintainable code.

 With a sound type system, when you change one piece of code, the type system can warn you about the other pieces of code that just broke.

*   Better ahead of time (AOT) compilation.

 While AOT compilation is possible without types, the generated code is much less efficient.

Tips for passing static analysis
--------------------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#tips-for-passing-static-analysis)

Most of the rules for static types are easy to understand. Here are some of the less obvious rules:

*   Use sound return types when overriding methods.
*   Use sound parameter types when overriding methods.
*   Don't use a dynamic list as a typed list.

Let's see these rules in detail, with examples that use the following type hierarchy:

[](https://dart.dev/language/type-system)

### Use sound return types when overriding methods

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#use-sound-return-types-when-overriding-methods)

The return type of a method in a subclass must be the same type or a subtype of the return type of the method in the superclass. Consider the getter method in the `Animal` class:

dart
```
class Animal {
  void chase(Animal a) {
     ...
  }
  Animal get parent => ...
}
```
content_copy

The `parent` getter method returns an `Animal`. In the `HoneyBadger` subclass, you can replace the getter's return type with `HoneyBadger` (or any other subtype of `Animal`), but an unrelated type is not allowed.

static analysis: success dart
```
class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(Animal a) {
     ...
  }
​
  @override
  HoneyBadger get parent => ...
}
```
content_copy

static analysis: failure dart
```
class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(Animal a) {
     ...
  }
​
  @override
  Root get parent => ...
}
```
content_copy

[](https://dart.dev/language/type-system)

### Use sound parameter types when overriding methods

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#use-sound-parameter-types-when-overriding-methods)

The parameter of an overridden method must have either the same type or a supertype of the corresponding parameter in the superclass. Don't "tighten" the parameter type by replacing the type with a subtype of the original parameter.

info Note

If you have a valid reason to use a subtype, you can use the [`covariant` keyword](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#covariant-keyword).

Consider the `chase(Animal)` method for the `Animal` class:

dart
```
class Animal {
  void chase(Animal a) {
     ...
  }
  Animal get parent => ...
}
```
content_copy

The `chase()` method takes an `Animal`. A `HoneyBadger` chases anything. It's OK to override the `chase()` method to take anything (`Object`).

static analysis: success dart
```
class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(Object a) {
     ...
  }
​
  @override
  Animal get parent => ...
}
```
content_copy

The following code tightens the parameter on the `chase()` method from `Animal` to `Mouse`, a subclass of `Animal`.

static analysis: failure dart
```
class Mouse extends Animal {
   ...
}
​
class Cat extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(Mouse a) {
     ...
  }
}
```
content_copy

This code is not type safe because it would then be possible to define a cat and send it after an alligator:

dart
```
Animal a = Cat();
a.chase(Alligator()); // Not type safe or feline safe.
```
content_copy

### Don't use a dynamic list as a typed list

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#dont-use-a-dynamic-list-as-a-typed-list)

A `dynamic` list is good when you want to have a list with different kinds of things in it. However, you can't use a `dynamic` list as a typed list.

This rule also applies to instances of generic types.

The following code creates a `dynamic` list of `Dog`, and assigns it to a list of type `Cat`, which generates an error during static analysis.

static analysis: failure dart
```
void main() {
  List<Cat> foo = <dynamic>[Dog()]; // Error
  List<dynamic> bar = <dynamic>[Dog(), Cat()]; // OK
}
```
content_copy

Runtime checks
--------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#runtime-checks)

Runtime checks deal with type safety issues that can't be detected at compile time.

For example, the following code throws an exception at runtime because it's an error to cast a list of dogs to a list of cats:

runtime: failure dart
```
void main() {
  List<Animal> animals = <Dog>[Dog()];
  List<Cat> cats = animals as List<Cat>;
}
```
content_copy

### Implicit downcasts from `dynamic`

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#implicit-downcasts-from-dynamic)

Expressions with a static type of `dynamic` can be implicitly cast to a more specific type. If the actual type doesn't match, the cast throws an error at run time. Consider the following `assumeString` method:

static analysis: success dart
```
int assumeString(dynamic object) {
  String string = object; // Check at run time that `object` is a `String`.
  return string.length;
}
```
content_copy

In this example, if `object` is a `String`, the cast succeeds. If it's not a subtype of `String`, such as `int`, a `TypeError` is thrown:

runtime: failure dart
```
final length = assumeString(1);
```
content_copy

lightbulb Tip

To prevent implicit downcasts from `dynamic` and avoid this issue, consider enabling the analyzer's _strict casts_ mode.

analysis_options.yaml

yaml
```
analyzer:
  language:
    strict-casts: true
```
content_copy

To learn more about customizing the analyzer's behavior, check out [Customizing static analysis](https://dart.dev/tools/analysis).

Type inference
--------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#type-inference)

The analyzer can infer types for fields, methods, local variables, and most generic type arguments. When the analyzer doesn't have enough information to infer a specific type, it uses the `dynamic` type.

Here's an example of how type inference works with generics. In this example, a variable named `arguments` holds a map that pairs string keys with values of various types.

If you explicitly type the variable, you might write this:

dart
```
Map<String, Object?> arguments = {'argA': 'hello', 'argB': 42};
```
content_copy

Alternatively, you can use `var` or `final` and let Dart infer the type:

dart
```
var arguments = {'argA': 'hello', 'argB': 42}; // Map<String, Object>
```
content_copy

The map literal infers its type from its entries, and then the variable infers its type from the map literal's type. In this map, the keys are both strings, but the values have different types (`String` and `int`, which have the upper bound `Object`). So the map literal has the type `Map<String, Object>`, and so does the `arguments` variable.

### Field and method inference

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#field-and-method-inference)

A field or method that has no specified type and that overrides a field or method from the superclass, inherits the type of the superclass method or field.

A field that does not have a declared or inherited type but that is declared with an initial value, gets an inferred type based on the initial value.

### Static field inference

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#static-field-inference)

Static fields and variables get their types inferred from their initializer. Note that inference fails if it encounters a cycle (that is, inferring a type for the variable depends on knowing the type of that variable).

### Local variable inference

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#local-variable-inference)

Local variable types are inferred from their initializer, if any. Subsequent assignments are not taken into account. This may mean that too precise a type may be inferred. If so, you can add a type annotation.

static analysis: failure dart
```
var x = 3; // x is inferred as an int.
x = 4.0;
```
content_copy

static analysis: success dart
```
num y = 3; // A num can be double or int.
y = 4.0;
```
content_copy

### Type argument inference

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#type-argument-inference)

Type arguments to constructor calls and [generic method](https://dart.dev/language/generics#using-generic-methods) invocations are inferred based on a combination of downward information from the context of occurrence, and upward information from the arguments to the constructor or generic method. If inference is not doing what you want or expect, you can always explicitly specify the type arguments.

static analysis: success dart
```
// Inferred as if you wrote <int>[].
List<int> listOfInt = [];
​
// Inferred as if you wrote <double>[3.0].
var listOfDouble = [3.0];
​
// Inferred as Iterable<int>.
var ints = listOfDouble.map((x) => x.toInt());
```
content_copy

In the last example, `x` is inferred as `double` using downward information. The return type of the closure is inferred as `int` using upward information. Dart uses this return type as upward information when inferring the `map()` method's type argument: `<int>`.

#### Inference using bounds

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#inference-using-bounds)

merge_type Version note

Inference using bounds requires a [language version](https://dart.dev/resources/language/evolution#language-versioning) of at least 3.7.0.

With the inference using bounds feature, Dart's type inference algorithm generates constraints by combining existing constraints with the declared type bounds, not just best-effort approximations.

This is especially important for [F-bounded](https://dart.dev/language/generics/#f-bounds) types, where inference using bounds correctly infers that, in the example below, `X` can be bound to `B`. Without the feature, the type argument must be specified explicitly: `f<B>(C())`:

dart
```
class A<X extends A<X>> {}
​
class B extends A<B> {}
​
class C extends B {}
​
void f<X extends A<X>>(X x) {}
​
void main() {
  f(B()); // OK.
​
  // OK. Without using bounds, inference relying on best-effort approximations
  // would fail after detecting that `C` is not a subtype of `A<C>`.
  f(C());
​
  f<B>(C()); // OK.
}
```
content_copy

Here's a more realistic example using everyday types in Dart like `int` or `num`:

dart
```
X max<X extends Comparable<X>>(X x1, X x2) => x1.compareTo(x2) > 0 ? x1 : x2;
​
void main() {
  // Inferred as `max<num>(3, 7)` with the feature, fails without it.
  max(3, 7);
}
```
content_copy

With inference using bounds, Dart can _deconstruct_ type arguments, extracting type information from a generic type parameter's bound. This allows functions like `f` in the following example to preserve both the specific iterable type (`List` or `Set`) _and_ the element type. Before inference using bounds, this wasn't possible without losing type safety or specific type information.

dart
```
(X, Y) f<X extends Iterable<Y>, Y>(X x) => (x, x.first);
​
void main() {
  var (myList, myInt) = f([1]);
  myInt.whatever; // Compile-time error, `myInt` has type `int`.
​
  var (mySet, myString) = f({'Hello!'});
  mySet.union({}); // Works, `mySet` has type `Set<String>`.
}
```
content_copy

Without inference using bounds, `myInt` would have the type `dynamic`. The previous inference algorithm wouldn't catch the incorrect expression `myInt.whatever` at compile time, and would instead throw at run time. Conversely, `mySet.union({})` would be a compile-time error without inference using bounds, because the previous algorithm couldn't preserve the information that `mySet` is a `Set`.

For more information on the inference using bounds algorithm, read the [design document](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/accepted/future-releases/3009-inference-using-bounds/design-document.md#motivating-example).

Substituting types
------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#substituting-types)

When you override a method, you are replacing something of one type (in the old method) with something that might have a new type (in the new method). Similarly, when you pass an argument to a function, you are replacing something that has one type (a parameter with a declared type) with something that has another type (the actual argument). When can you replace something that has one type with something that has a subtype or a supertype?

When substituting types, it helps to think in terms of _consumers_ and _producers_. A consumer absorbs a type and a producer generates a type.

**You can replace a consumer's type with a supertype and a producer's type with a subtype.**

Let's look at examples of simple type assignment and assignment with generic types.

### Simple type assignment

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#simple-type-assignment)

When assigning objects to objects, when can you replace a type with a different type? The answer depends on whether the object is a consumer or a producer.

Consider the following type hierarchy:

Consider the following simple assignment where `Cat c` is a _consumer_ and `Cat()` is a _producer_:

dart
```
Cat c = Cat();
```
content_copy

In a consuming position, it's safe to replace something that consumes a specific type (`Cat`) with something that consumes anything (`Animal`), so replacing `Cat c` with `Animal c` is allowed, because `Animal` is a supertype of `Cat`.

static analysis: success dart
```
Animal c = Cat();
```
content_copy

But replacing `Cat c` with `MaineCoon c` breaks type safety, because the superclass may provide a type of Cat with different behaviors, such as `Lion`:

static analysis: failure dart
```
MaineCoon c = Cat();
```
content_copy

In a producing position, it's safe to replace something that produces a type (`Cat`) with a more specific type (`MaineCoon`). So, the following is allowed:

static analysis: success dart
```
Cat c = MaineCoon();
```
content_copy

### Generic type assignment

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#generic-type-assignment)

Are the rules the same for generic types? Yes. Consider the hierarchy of lists of animals—a `List` of `Cat` is a subtype of a `List` of `Animal`, and a supertype of a `List` of `MaineCoon`:

In the following example, you can assign a `MaineCoon` list to `myCats` because `List<MaineCoon>` is a subtype of `List<Cat>`:

static analysis: success dart
```
List<MaineCoon> myMaineCoons = ...
List<Cat> myCats = myMaineCoons;
```
content_copy

What about going in the other direction? Can you assign an `Animal` list to a `List<Cat>`?

static analysis: failure dart
```
List<Animal> myAnimals = ...
List<Cat> myCats = myAnimals;
```
content_copy

This assignment doesn't pass static analysis because it creates an implicit downcast, which is disallowed from non-`dynamic` types such as `Animal`.

To make this type of code pass static analysis, you can use an explicit cast.

dart
```
List<Animal> myAnimals = ...
List<Cat> myCats = myAnimals as List<Cat>;
```
content_copy

An explicit cast might still fail at runtime, though, depending on the actual type of the list being cast (`myAnimals`).

### Methods

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#methods)

When overriding a method, the producer and consumer rules still apply. For example:

For a consumer (such as the `chase(Animal)` method), you can replace the parameter type with a supertype. For a producer (such as the `parent` getter method), you can replace the return type with a subtype.

For more information, see [Use sound return types when overriding methods](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#use-proper-return-types) and [Use sound parameter types when overriding methods](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#use-proper-param-types).

[](https://dart.dev/language/type-system)

#### Covariant parameters

[#](https://dart.dev/language/type-system#covariant-parameters)

Some (rarely used) coding patterns rely on tightening a type by overriding a parameter's type with a subtype, which is invalid. In this case, you can use the `covariant` keyword to tell the analyzer that you're doing this intentionally. This removes the static error and instead checks for an invalid argument type at runtime.

The following shows how you might use `covariant`:

static analysis: success dart
```
class Animal {
  void chase(Animal x) {
     ...
  }
}
​
class Mouse extends Animal {
   ...
}
​
class Cat extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(covariant Mouse x) {
     ...
  }
}
```
content_copy

Although this example shows using `covariant` in the subtype, the `covariant` keyword can be placed in either the superclass or the subclass method. Usually the superclass method is the best place to put it. The `covariant` keyword applies to a single parameter and is also supported on setters and fields.
