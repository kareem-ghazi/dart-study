# Introduction to Dart

A brief introduction to Dart programs and important concepts.

This page provides a brief introduction to the Dart language through samples of its main features.

To learn more about the Dart language, visit the in-depth, individual topic pages listed under **Language** in the left side menu.

For coverage of Dart's core libraries, check out the [core library documentation](https://dart.dev/libraries). You can also check out the [Dart cheatsheet](https://dart.dev/resources/dart-cheatsheet), for a more interactive introduction.

## Hello World

Every app requires the top-level `main()` function, where execution starts. Functions that don't explicitly return a value have the `void` return type. To display text on the console, you can use the top-level `print()` function:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

Read more about [the `main()` function](https://dart.dev/language/functions#the-main-function) in Dart, including optional parameters for command-line arguments.

## Variables

Even in [type-safe](https://dart.dev/language/type-system) Dart code, you can declare most variables without explicitly specifying their type using `var`. Thanks to type inference, these variables' types are determined by their initial values:

```dart
var name = 'Voyager I';
var year = 1977;
var antennaDiameter = 3.7;
var flybyObjects = ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'];
var image = {
  'tags': ['saturn'],
  'url': '//path/to/saturn.jpg',
};
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/variables) about variables in Dart, including default values, the `final` and `const` keywords, and static types.

## Control flow statements

Dart supports the usual control flow statements:

```dart
if (year >= 2001) {
  print('21st century');
} else if (year >= 1901) {
  print('20th century');
}

for (final object in flybyObjects) {
  print(object);
}

for (int month = 1; month <= 12; month++) {
  print(month);
}

while (year < 2016) {
  year += 1;
}
```

Read more about control flow statements in Dart, including [`break` and `continue`](https://dart.dev/language/loops), [`switch` and `case`](https://dart.dev/language/branches), and [`assert`](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling#assert).

## Functions

[We recommend](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/design#types) specifying the types of each function's arguments and return value:

```dart
int fibonacci(int n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

var result = fibonacci(20);
```

A shorthand `=>` (_arrow_) syntax is handy for functions that contain a single statement. This syntax is especially useful when passing anonymous functions as arguments:

```dart
flybyObjects.where((name) => name.contains('turn')).forEach(print);
```

Besides showing an anonymous function (the argument to `where()`), this code shows that you can use a function as an argument: the top-level `print()` function is an argument to `forEach()`.

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/functions) about functions in Dart, including optional parameters, default parameter values, and lexical scope.

## Comments

Dart comments usually start with `//`.

```dart
// This is a normal, one-line comment.

/// This is a documentation comment, used to document libraries,
/// classes, and their members. Tools like IDEs and dartdoc treat
/// doc comments specially.

/* Comments like these are also supported. */
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/comments) about comments in Dart, including how the documentation tooling works.

## Imports

To access APIs defined in other libraries, use `import`.

```dart
// Importing core libraries
import 'dart:math';

// Importing libraries from external packages
import 'package:test/test.dart';

// Importing files
import 'path/to/my_other_file.dart';
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/libraries) about libraries and visibility in Dart, including library prefixes, `show` and `hide`, and lazy loading through the `deferred` keyword.

## Classes

Here's an example of a class with three properties, two constructors, and a method. One of the properties can't be set directly, so it's defined using a getter method (instead of a variable). The method uses string interpolation to print variables' string equivalents inside of string literals.

```dart
class Spacecraft {
  String name;
  DateTime? launchDate;

  // Read-only non-final property
  int? get launchYear => launchDate?.year;

  // Constructor, with syntactic sugar for assignment to members.
  Spacecraft(this.name, this.launchDate) {
    // Initialization code goes here.
  }

  // Named constructor that forwards to the default one.
  Spacecraft.unlaunched(String name) : this(name, null);

  // Method.
  void describe() {
    print('Spacecraft: $name');
    // Type promotion doesn't work on getters.
    var launchDate = this.launchDate;
    if (launchDate != null) {
      int years = DateTime.now().difference(launchDate).inDays ~/ 365;
      print('Launched: $launchYear ($years years ago)');
    } else {
      print('Unlaunched');
    }
  }
}
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#strings) about strings, including string interpolation, literals, expressions, and the `toString()` method.

You might use the `Spacecraft` class like this:

```dart
var voyager = Spacecraft('Voyager I', DateTime(1977, 9, 5));
voyager.describe();

var voyager3 = Spacecraft.unlaunched('Voyager III');
voyager3.describe();
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/classes) about classes in Dart, including initializer lists, optional `new` and `const`, redirecting constructors, `factory` constructors, getters, setters, and much more.

## Enums

Enums are a way of enumerating a predefined set of values or instances in a way which ensures that there cannot be any other instances of that type.

Here is an example of a simple `enum` that defines a simple list of predefined planet types:

```dart
enum PlanetType { terrestrial, gas, ice }
```

Here is an example of an enhanced enum declaration of a class describing planets, with a defined set of constant instances, namely the planets of our own solar system.

```dart
/// Enum that enumerates the different planets in our solar system
/// and some of their properties.
enum Planet {
  mercury(planetType: PlanetType.terrestrial, moons: 0, hasRings: false),
  venus(planetType: PlanetType.terrestrial, moons: 0, hasRings: false),
  // ···
  uranus(planetType: PlanetType.ice, moons: 27, hasRings: true),
  neptune(planetType: PlanetType.ice, moons: 14, hasRings: true);

  /// A constant generating constructor
  const Planet({
    required this.planetType,
    required this.moons,
    required this.hasRings,
  });

  /// All instance variables are final
  final PlanetType planetType;
  final int moons;
  final bool hasRings;

  /// Enhanced enums support getters and other methods
  bool get isGiant =>
      planetType == PlanetType.gas || planetType == PlanetType.ice;
}
```

You might use the `Planet` enum like this:

```dart
final yourPlanet = Planet.earth;

if (!yourPlanet.isGiant) {
  print('Your planet is not a "giant planet".');
}
```

When the compiler can infer the enum type from the context, you can use the more concise dot-shorthand syntax to access enum values. Instead of writing the full `EnumName.value`, you can just write `.value`. This can make your code cleaner and easier to read.

For example, when declaring a variable with an explicit type of `Planet`, you can omit the enum name because the type of `Planet` is already established:

```dart
// Instead of the full, explicit syntax:
Planet myPlanet = Planet.venus;

// You can use a dot shorthand:
Planet myPlanet = .venus;
```

Dot shorthands aren't limited to variable declarations. They can also be used in contexts like function arguments and switch cases where the enum type is clear to the compiler.

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/enums) about enums in Dart, including enhanced enum requirements, automatically introduced properties, accessing enumerated value names, switch statement support, and much more. [Read more](https://dart.dev/language/dot-shorthands) about dot shorthand syntax.

## Inheritance

Dart has single inheritance.

```dart
class Orbiter extends Spacecraft {
  double altitude;

  Orbiter(super.name, DateTime super.launchDate, this.altitude);
}
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/extend) about extending classes, the optional `@override` annotation, and more.

## Mixins

Mixins are a way of reusing code in multiple class hierarchies. The following is a mixin declaration:

```dart
mixin Piloted {
  int astronauts = 1;

  void describeCrew() {
    print('Number of astronauts: $astronauts');
  }
}
```

To add a mixin's capabilities to a class, just extend the class with the mixin.

```dart
class PilotedCraft extends Spacecraft with Piloted {
  // ···
}
```

`PilotedCraft` now has the `astronauts` field as well as the `describeCrew()` method.

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/mixins) about mixins.

## Interfaces and abstract classes

All classes implicitly define an interface. Therefore, you can implement any class.

```dart
class MockSpaceship implements Spacecraft {
  // ···
}
```

Read more about [implicit interfaces](https://dart.dev/language/classes#implicit-interfaces), or about the explicit [`interface` keyword](https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#interface).

You can create an abstract class to be extended (or implemented) by a concrete class. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (with empty bodies).

```dart
abstract class Describable {
  void describe();

  void describeWithEmphasis() {
    print('=========');
    describe();
    print('=========');
  }
}
```

Any class extending `Describable` has the `describeWithEmphasis()` method, which calls the extender's implementation of `describe()`.

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#abstract) about abstract classes and methods.

## Async

Avoid callback hell and make your code much more readable by using `async` and `await`.

```dart
const oneSecond = Duration(seconds: 1);
// ···
Future<void> printWithDelay(String message) async {
  await Future.delayed(oneSecond);
  print(message);
}
```

The method above is equivalent to:

```dart
Future<void> printWithDelay(String message) {
  return Future.delayed(oneSecond).then((_) {
    print(message);
  });
}
```

As the next example shows, `async` and `await` help make asynchronous code easy to read.

```dart
Future<void> createDescriptions(Iterable<String> objects) async {
  for (final object in objects) {
    try {
      var file = File('$object.txt');
      if (await file.exists()) {
        var modified = await file.lastModified();
        print(
          'File for $object already exists. It was modified on $modified.',
        );
        continue;
      }
      await file.create();
      await file.writeAsString('Start describing $object in this file.');
    } on IOException catch (e) {
      print('Cannot create description for $object: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use `async*`, which gives you a nice, readable way to build streams.

```dart
Stream<String> report(Spacecraft craft, Iterable<String> objects) async* {
  for (final object in objects) {
    await Future.delayed(oneSecond);
    yield '${craft.name} flies by $object';
  }
}
```

[Read more](https://dart.dev/language/async) about asynchrony support, including `async` functions, `Future`, `Stream`, and the asynchronous loop (`await for`).

## Exceptions

To raise an exception, use `throw`:

```dart
if (astronauts == 0) {
  throw StateError('No astronauts.');
}
```

To catch an exception, use a `try` statement with `on` or `catch` (or both):

```dart
Future<void> describeFlybyObjects(List<String> flybyObjects) async {
  try {
    for (final object in flybyObjects) {
      var description = await File('$object.txt').readAsString();
      print(description);
    }
  } on IOException catch (e) {
    print('Could not describe object: $e');
  } finally {
    flybyObjects.clear();
  }
}
```

Note that the code above is asynchronous; `try` works for both synchronous and asynchronous code in an `async` function.

## Important concepts

As you continue to learn about the Dart language, keep these facts and concepts in mind:

*   Everything you can place in a variable is an _object_, and every object is an instance of a _class_. Even numbers, functions, and `null` are objects. With the exception of `null` (if you enable [sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety)), all objects inherit from the [`Object`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/Object-class.html) class.

*   **Version note:** [Null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) was introduced in Dart 2.12. Using null safety requires a [language version](https://dart.dev/resources/language/evolution#language-versioning) of at least 2.12.

*   Although Dart is strongly typed, type annotations are optional because Dart can infer types. In `var number = 101`, `number` is inferred to be of type `int`.

*   Variables can't contain `null` unless you say they can. You can make a variable nullable by putting a question mark (`?`) at the end of its type. For example, a variable of type `int?` might be an integer, or it might be `null`. If you _know_ that an expression never evaluates to `null` but Dart disagrees, you can add `!` to assert that it isn't null (and to throw an exception if it is). An example: `int x = nullableButNotNullInt!`

*   When you want to explicitly say that any type is allowed, use the type `Object?` (if you've enabled null safety), `Object`, or—if you must defer type checking until runtime—the [special type `dynamic`](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/design#avoid-using-dynamic-unless-you-want-to-disable-static-checking).

*   Dart supports generic types, like `List<int>` (a list of integers) or `List<Object>` (a list of objects of any type).

*   Dart supports top-level functions (such as `main()`), as well as functions tied to a class or object (_static_ and _instance methods_, respectively). You can also create functions within functions (_nested_ or _local functions_).

*   Similarly, Dart supports top-level _variables_, as well as variables tied to a class or object (static and instance variables). Instance variables are sometimes known as _fields_ or _properties_.

*   Unlike Java, Dart doesn't have the keywords `public`, `protected`, and `private`. If an identifier starts with an underscore (`_`), it's private to its library. For details, see [Libraries and imports](https://dart.dev/language/libraries).

*   _Identifiers_ can start with a letter or underscore (`_`), followed by any combination of those characters plus digits.

*   Dart has both _expressions_ (which have runtime values) and _statements_ (which don't). For example, the [conditional expression](https://dart.dev/language/operators#conditional-expressions)`condition ? expr1 : expr2` has a value of `expr1` or `expr2`. Compare that to an [if-else statement](https://dart.dev/language/branches#if), which has no value. A statement often contains one or more expressions, but an expression can't directly contain a statement.

*   Dart tools can report two kinds of problems: _warnings_ and _errors_. Warnings are just indications that your code might not work, but they don't prevent your program from executing. Errors can be either compile-time or run-time. A compile-time error prevents the code from executing at all; a run-time error results in an [exception](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling#exceptions) being raised while the code executes.
