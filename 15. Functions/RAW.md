Dart is a true object-oriented language, so even functions are objects and have a type, [Function.](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/Function-class.html) This means that functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. You can also call an instance of a Dart class as if it were a function. For details, see [Callable objects](https://dart.dev/language/callable-objects).

Here's an example of implementing a function:

dart
```
bool isNoble(int atomicNumber) {
  return _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;
}
```
content_copy

Although Effective Dart recommends [type annotations for public APIs](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/design#do-type-annotate-fields-and-top-level-variables-if-the-type-isnt-obvious), the function still works if you omit the types:

dart
```
isNoble(atomicNumber) {
  return _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;
}
```
content_copy

For functions that contain just one expression, you can use a shorthand syntax:

dart
```
bool isNoble(int atomicNumber) => _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;
```
content_copy

The `=> expr` syntax is a shorthand for `{ return expr; }`. The `=>` notation is sometimes referred to as _arrow_ syntax.

info Note

Only _expressions_ can appear between the arrow (`=>`) and the semicolon (`;`). Expressions evaluate to values. This means that you can't write a statement where Dart expects a value. For example, you could use a [conditional expression](https://dart.dev/language/operators#conditional-expressions) but not an [if statement](https://dart.dev/language/branches#if). In the previous example, `_nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;` returns a boolean value. The function then returns a boolean value that indicates whether the `atomicNumber` falls into the noble gas range.

Parameters
----------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#parameters)

A function can have any number of _required positional_ parameters. These can be followed either by _named_ parameters or by _optional positional_ parameters (but not both).

info Note

Some APIs—notably [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) widget constructors—use only named parameters, even for parameters that are mandatory. See the next section for details.

You can use [trailing commas](https://dart.dev/language/collections#lists) when you pass arguments to a function or when you define function parameters.

### Named parameters

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#named-parameters)

Named parameters are optional unless they're explicitly marked as `required`.

When defining a function, use `{param1, param2, …}` to specify named parameters. If you don't provide a default value or mark a named parameter as `required`, their types must be nullable as their default value will be `null`:

dart
```
/// Sets the [bold] and [hidden] flags ...
void enableFlags({bool? bold, bool? hidden}) {
  ...
}
```
content_copy

When calling a function, you can specify named arguments using `paramName: value`. For example:

dart
```
enableFlags(bold: true, hidden: false);
```
content_copy

[](https://dart.dev/language/functions) To define a default value for a named parameter besides `null`, use `=` to specify a default value. The specified value must be a compile-time constant. For example:

dart
```
/// Sets the [bold] and [hidden] flags ...
void enableFlags({bool bold = false, bool hidden = false}) {
  ...
}
​
// bold will be true; hidden will be false.
enableFlags(bold: true);
```
content_copy

If you instead want a named parameter to be mandatory, requiring callers to provide a value for the parameter, annotate them with `required`:

dart
```
const Scrollbar({super.key, required Widget child});
```
content_copy

If someone tries to create a `Scrollbar` without specifying the `child` argument, then the analyzer reports an issue.

info Note

A parameter marked as `required` can still be nullable:

dart
```
const Scrollbar({super.key, required Widget? child});
```
content_copy

You might want to place positional arguments first, but Dart doesn't require it. Dart allows named arguments to be placed anywhere in the argument list when it suits your API:

dart
```
repeat(times: 2, () {
  ...
});
```
content_copy

### Optional positional parameters

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#optional-positional-parameters)

Wrapping a set of function parameters in `[]` marks them as optional positional parameters. If you don't provide a default value, their types must be nullable as their default value will be `null`:

dart
```
String say(String from, String msg, [String? device]) {
  var result = '$from says $msg';
  if (device != null) {
    result = '$result with a $device';
  }
  return result;
}
```
content_copy

Here's an example of calling this function without the optional parameter:

dart
```
assert(say('Bob', 'Howdy') == 'Bob says Howdy');
```
content_copy

And here's an example of calling this function with the third parameter:

dart
```
assert(
  say('Bob', 'Howdy', 'smoke signal') ==
      'Bob says Howdy with a smoke signal',
);
```
content_copy

To define a default value for an optional positional parameter besides `null`, use `=` to specify a default value. The specified value must be a compile-time constant. For example:

dart
```
String say(String from, String msg, [String device = 'carrier pigeon']) {
  var result = '$from says $msg with a $device';
  return result;
}
​
assert(say('Bob', 'Howdy') == 'Bob says Howdy with a carrier pigeon');
```
content_copy

The main() function
-------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#main)

Every app must have a top-level `main()` function, which serves as the entrypoint to the app. The `main()` function returns `void` and has an optional `List<String>` parameter for arguments.

Here's a simple `main()` function:

dart
```
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```
content_copy

Here's an example of the `main()` function for a command-line app that takes arguments:

args.dart

dart
```
// Run the app like this: dart run args.dart 1 test
void main(List<String> arguments) {
  print(arguments);
​
  assert(arguments.length == 2);
  assert(int.parse(arguments[0]) == 1);
  assert(arguments[1] == 'test');
}
```
content_copy

You can use the [args library](https://pub.dev/packages/args) to define and parse command-line arguments.

Functions as first-class objects
--------------------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#functions-as-first-class-objects)

You can pass a function as a parameter to another function. For example:

dart
```
void printElement(int element) {
  print(element);
}
​
var list = [1, 2, 3];
​
// Pass printElement as a parameter.
list.forEach(printElement);
```
content_copy

You can also assign a function to a variable, such as:

dart
```
var loudify = (msg) => '!!! ${msg.toUpperCase()} !!!';
assert(loudify('hello') == '!!! HELLO !!!');
```
content_copy

This example uses an anonymous function. More about those in the next section.

Function types
--------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#function-types)

You can specify the type of a function, which is known as a _function type_. A function type is obtained from a function declaration header by replacing the function name by the keyword `Function`. Moreover, you are allowed to omit the names of positional parameters, but the names of named parameters can't be omitted. For example:

dart
```
void greet(String name, {String greeting = 'Hello'}) =>
    print('$greeting $name!');
​
// Store `greet` in a variable and call it.
void Function(String, {String greeting}) g = greet;
g('Dash', greeting: 'Howdy');
```
content_copy

info Note

In Dart, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

You can use a [`typedef`](https://dart.dev/language/typedefs) declaration to explicitly name function types, which can be useful for clarity and reusability.

Anonymous functions
-------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#anonymous-functions)

Though you name most functions, such as `main()` or `printElement()`, you can also create functions without names. These functions are called _anonymous functions_, _lambdas_, or _closures_.

An anonymous function resembles a named function as it has:

*   Zero or more parameters, comma-separated
*   Optional type annotations between parentheses.

The following code block contains the function's body:

dart
```
([[Type] param1[, ...]]) {
  codeBlock;
}
```
content_copy

The following example defines an anonymous function with an untyped parameter, `item`. The anonymous function passes it to the `map` function. The `map` function, invoked for each item in the list, converts each string to uppercase. Then, the anonymous function passed to `forEach`, prints each converted string with its length.

dart
```
const list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges'];
​
var uppercaseList = list.map((item) {
  return item.toUpperCase();
}).toList();
// Convert to list after mapping
​
for (var item in uppercaseList) {
  print('$item: ${item.length}');
}
```
content_copy

Click **Run** to execute the code.

```
void main() {
  const list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges'];

  var uppercaseList = list.map((item) {
    return item.toUpperCase();
  }).toList();
  // Convert to list after mapping

  for (var item in uppercaseList) {
    print('$item: ${item.length}');
  }
}
```

If the function contains only a single expression or return statement, you can shorten it using arrow notation. Paste the following line into DartPad and click **Run** to verify that it is functionally equivalent.

dart
```
var uppercaseList = list.map((item) => item.toUpperCase()).toList();
uppercaseList.forEach((item) => print('$item: ${item.length}'));
```
content_copy

Lexical scope
-------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#lexical-scope)

Dart determines the scope of variables based on the layout of its code. A programming language with this feature is termed a lexically scoped language. You can "follow the curly braces outwards" to see if a variable is in scope.

**Example:** A series of nested functions with variables at each scope level:

dart
```
bool topLevel = true;
​
void main() {
  var insideMain = true;
​
  void myFunction() {
    var insideFunction = true;
​
    void nestedFunction() {
      var insideNestedFunction = true;
​
      assert(topLevel);
      assert(insideMain);
      assert(insideFunction);
      assert(insideNestedFunction);
    }
  }
}
```
content_copy

The `nestedFunction()` method can use variables from every level, all the way up to the top level.

Lexical closures
----------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#lexical-closures)

A function object that can access variables in its lexical scope when the function sits outside that scope is called a _closure_.

Functions can close over variables defined in surrounding scopes. In the following example, `makeAdder()` captures the variable `addBy`. Wherever the returned function goes, it remembers `addBy`.

dart
```
/// Returns a function that adds [addBy] to the
/// function's argument.
Function makeAdder(int addBy) {
  return (int i) => addBy + i;
}
​
void main() {
  // Create a function that adds 2.
  var add2 = makeAdder(2);
​
  // Create a function that adds 4.
  var add4 = makeAdder(4);
​
  assert(add2(3) == 5);
  assert(add4(3) == 7);
}
```
content_copy

Tear-offs
---------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#tear-offs)

When you refer to a function, method, or named constructor without parentheses, Dart creates a _tear-off_. This is a closure that takes the same parameters as the function and invokes the underlying function when you call it. If your code needs a closure that invokes a named function with the same parameters as the closure accepts, don't wrap the call in a lambda. Use a tear-off.

dart
```
var charCodes = [68, 97, 114, 116];
var buffer = StringBuffer();
```
content_copy

good dart
```
// Function tear-off
charCodes.forEach(print);
​
// Method tear-off
charCodes.forEach(buffer.write);
```
content_copy

bad dart
```
// Function lambda
charCodes.forEach((code) {
  print(code);
});
​
// Method lambda
charCodes.forEach((code) {
  buffer.write(code);
});
```
content_copy

Testing functions for equality
------------------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#testing-functions-for-equality)

Here's an example of testing top-level functions, static methods, and instance methods for equality:

dart
```
void foo() {} // A top-level function
​
class A {
  static void bar() {} // A static method
  void baz() {} // An instance method
}
​
void main() {
  Function x;
​
  // Comparing top-level functions.
  x = foo;
  assert(foo == x);
​
  // Comparing static methods.
  x = A.bar;
  assert(A.bar == x);
​
  // Comparing instance methods.
  var v = A(); // Instance #1 of A
  var w = A(); // Instance #2 of A
  var y = w;
  x = w.baz;
​
  // These closures refer to the same instance (#2),
  // so they're equal.
  assert(y.baz == x);
​
  // These closures refer to different instances,
  // so they're unequal.
  assert(v.baz != w.baz);
}
```
content_copy

Return values
-------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#return-values)

All functions return a value. If no return value is specified, the statement `return null;` is implicitly appended to the function body.

dart
```
foo() {}
​
assert(foo() == null);
```
content_copy

To return multiple values in a function, aggregate the values in a [record](https://dart.dev/language/records#multiple-returns).

dart
```
(String, int) foo() {
  return ('something', 42);
}
```
content_copy

Getters and setters
-------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#getters-and-setters)

Every property access (top-level, static, or instance) is an invocation of a getter or a setter. A variable implicitly creates a getter and, if it's mutable, a setter. This is why when you access a property, you're actually calling a small function in the background. Reading a property calls a getter function, and writing one calls a setter function, even in cases where the property is declared a variable.

However, you can also declare getters and setters explicitly with the `get` and `set` keywords respectively. This allows a property's value to be computed when it's read or written.

The purpose of using getters and setters is to create a clear separation between the client (the code that uses the property) and the provider (the class or library that defines it). The client asks for or sets a value without needing to know if that value is stored in a simple variable or calculated on the spot. This gives the provider the freedom to change how the property works.

For example, because the value of the property might not be stored anywhere, it could be computed each time the getter is called. Another example is that when a value is stored in a private variable, and public access is only allowed by calling a getter or a setter.

The following example showcases this, with the `secret` getter and setter providing indirect access to the private variable `_secret` with its own manipulations on the assigned and retrieved values.

dart
```
// Defines a variable `_secret` that is private to the library since
// its identifier starts with an underscore (`_`).
String _secret = 'Hello';
​
// A public top-level getter that
// provides read access to [_secret].
String get secret {
  print('Getter was used!');
  return _secret.toUpperCase();
}
​
// A public top-level setter that
// provides write access to [_secret].
set secret(String newMessage) {
  print('Setter was used!');
  if (newMessage.isNotEmpty) {
    _secret = newMessage;
    print('New secret: "$newMessage"');
  }
}
​
void main() {
  // Reading the value calls the getter.
  print('Current message: $secret');
​
  /*
  Output:
  Getter was used!
  Current message: HELLO
  */
​
  // Assigning a value calls the setter.
  secret = 'Dart is fun';
​
  // Reading it again calls the getter to show the new computed value
  print('New message: $secret');
​
  /*
  Output:
  Setter was used! New secret: "Dart is fun"
  Getter was used!
  New message: DART IS FUN
  */
}
```
content_copy

Generators
----------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#generators)

When you need to lazily produce a sequence of values, consider using a _generator function_. Dart has built-in support for two kinds of generator functions:

*   **Synchronous** generator: Returns an [`Iterable`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/Iterable-class.html) object. 
*   **Asynchronous** generator: Returns a [`Stream`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-async/Stream-class.html) object. 

To implement a **synchronous** generator function, mark the function body as `sync*`, and use `yield` statements to deliver values:

dart
```
Iterable<int> naturalsTo(int n) sync* {
  int k = 0;
  while (k < n) yield k++;
}
```
content_copy

To implement an **asynchronous** generator function, mark the function body as `async*`, and use `yield` statements to deliver values:

dart
```
Stream<int> asynchronousNaturalsTo(int n) async* {
  int k = 0;
  while (k < n) yield k++;
}
```
content_copy

If your generator is recursive, you can improve its performance by using `yield*`:

dart
```
Iterable<int> naturalsDownFrom(int n) sync* {
  if (n > 0) {
    yield n;
    yield* naturalsDownFrom(n - 1);
  }
}
```
content_copy

External functions
------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/functions#external)

An external function is a function whose body is implemented separately from its declaration. Include the `external` keyword before a function declaration, like so:

dart
```
external void someFunc(int i);
```
content_copy

An external function's implementation can come from another Dart library, or, more commonly, from another language. In interop contexts, `external` introduces type information for foreign functions or values, making them usable in Dart. Implementation and usage is heavily platform specific, so check out the interop docs on, for example, [C](https://dart.dev/interop/c-interop) or [JavaScript](https://dart.dev/interop/js-interop) to learn more.

External functions can be top-level functions, [instance methods](https://dart.dev/language/methods#instance-methods), getters or setters, or [non-redirecting constructors](https://dart.dev/language/constructors#redirecting-constructors). An [instance variable](https://dart.dev/language/classes#instance-variables) can be `external` too, which is equivalent to an external getter and (if the variable is not `final`) an external setter.
