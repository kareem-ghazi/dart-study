# Dart Study Guide 🎯

Welcome to this structured Dart programming study repository. This project is designed to help you master Dart through a combination of official documentation, simplified bilingual notes (English/Arabic), and practical coding assignments.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each topic is organized into its own numbered folder (e.g., `0. Introduction to Dart`, `1. Variables`). Inside each folder, you will find:

*   **`RAW.md`**: The raw content sourced from official Dart documentation.
*   **`PAGE.md`**: A clean, formatted version of the documentation for easy reading.
*   **`NOTES.md`**: 📝 **Key Study Material**. Summarized bilingual notes (English & Arabic), explaining concepts simply with analogies and key takeaways.
*   **`ASSIGNMENTS.md`**: 💻 **Practice**. Three levels of coding tasks (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) with full solutions included.

## 📚 Topics Covered

1.  **[0. Introduction to Dart](./0.%20Introduction%20to%20Dart)**
    *   Basic syntax, `main()` function, and printing.
2.  **[1. Variables](./1.%20Variables)**
    *   `var`, `final`, `const`, and default values.
3.  **[2. Operators](./2.%20Operators)**
    *   Arithmetic, equality, logical, and type test operators.
4.  **[3. Comments](./3.%20Comments)**
    *   Single-line, multi-line, and documentation comments.
5.  **[4. Built-in types](./4.%20Built-in%20types)**
    *   Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Runes, and Symbols.
6.  **[5. Records](./5.%20Records)**
    *   Grouping multiple values, positional/named fields, and destructuring.
7.  **[6. Collections](./6.%20Collections)**
    *   Lists, Sets, Maps, and control flow operators (`if`, `for`, spread `...`).
8.  **[7. Generics](./7.%20Generics)**
    *   Writing reusable type-safe code (`<T>`), generic collections, and methods.
9.  **[8. Typedef](./8.%20Typedef)**
    *   Creating type aliases for function signatures and complex types.
10. **[9. The Dart type system](./9.%20The%20Dart%20type%20system)**
    *   Soundness, type inference, type safety, and the `covariant` keyword.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Read** the `NOTES.md` in a topic folder to grasp the concepts.
2.  **Refer** to `PAGE.md` if you need deep technical details.
3.  **Solve** the challenges in `ASSIGNMENTS.md` to reinforce your learning.
4.  **Check** your answers against the provided solutions.

Happy Coding! 💙
