Methods are functions that provide behavior for an object.

Instance methods
----------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/methods#instance-methods)

Instance methods on objects can access instance variables and `this`. The `distanceTo()` method in the following sample is an example of an instance method:

dart
```
import 'dart:math';
​
class Point {
  final double x;
  final double y;
​
  // Sets the x and y instance variables
  // before the constructor body runs.
  Point(this.x, this.y);
​
  double distanceTo(Point other) {
    var dx = x - other.x;
    var dy = y - other.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  }
​
}
```

Operators
---------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/methods#operators)

Most operators are instance methods with special names. Dart allows you to define operators with the following names:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<` | `>` | `<=` | `>=` | `==` | `~` |
| `-` | `+` | `/` | `~/` | `*` | `%` |
| `|` | `ˆ` | `&` | `<<` | `>>>` | `>>` |
| `[]=` | `[]` |  |  |  |  |

info Note

You may have noticed that some [operators](https://dart.dev/language/operators), like `!=`, aren't in the list of names. These operators aren't instance methods. Their behavior is built in to Dart.

To declare an operator, use the built-in identifier `operator` then the operator you are defining. The following example defines vector addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), and equality (`==`):

dart
```
class Vector {
  final int x, y;
​
  Vector(this.x, this.y);
​
  Vector operator +(Vector v) => Vector(x + v.x, y + v.y);
  Vector operator -(Vector v) => Vector(x - v.x, y - v.y);
​
  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
      other is Vector && x == other.x && y == other.y;
​
  @override
  int get hashCode => Object.hash(x, y);
}
​
void main() {
  final v = Vector(2, 3);
  final w = Vector(2, 2);
​
  assert(v + w == Vector(4, 5));
  assert(v - w == Vector(0, 1));
}
```

Getters and setters
-------------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/methods#getters-and-setters)

Getters and setters are special methods that provide read and write access to an object's properties. Recall that each instance variable has an implicit getter, plus a setter if appropriate. You can create additional properties by implementing getters and setters, using the `get` and `set` keywords:

dart
```
/// A rectangle in a screen coordinate system,
/// where the origin `(0, 0)` is in the top-left corner.
class Rectangle {
  double left, top, width, height;
​
  Rectangle(this.left, this.top, this.width, this.height);
​
  // Define two calculated properties: right and bottom.
  double get right => left + width;
  set right(double value) => left = value - width;
  double get bottom => top + height;
  set bottom(double value) => top = value - height;
}
​
void main() {
  var rect = Rectangle(3, 4, 20, 15);
  assert(rect.left == 3);
  rect.right = 12;
  assert(rect.left == -8);
}
```

With getters and setters, you can start with instance variables, later wrapping them with methods, all without changing client code.

info Note

Operators such as increment (`++`) work in the expected way, whether or not a getter is explicitly defined. To avoid any unexpected side effects, the operator calls the getter exactly once, saving its value in a temporary variable.

Abstract methods
----------------

[#](https://dart.dev/language/methods#abstract-methods)

Instance, getter, and setter methods can be abstract, defining an interface but leaving its implementation up to other classes. Abstract methods can only exist in [abstract classes](https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#abstract) or [mixins](https://dart.dev/language/mixins).

To make a method abstract, use a semicolon (`;`) instead of a method body:

dart
```
abstract class Doer {
  // Define instance variables and methods...
​
  void doSomething(); // Define an abstract method.
}
​
class EffectiveDoer extends Doer {
  void doSomething() {
    // Provide an implementation, so the method is not abstract here...
  }
}
```
